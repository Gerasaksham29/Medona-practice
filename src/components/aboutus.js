                of required drug and within a certain radius of his/her location, the system will fetch a list of all pharmacies and hospitals in 
                which that particular drug is available along with the contact details and opening hours of the store. With this website people 
                won't have to go to different stores amidst lockdown to find a drug. </p>
            <p>We have implemented a blockchain system for the important drugs like remdisivir and oxygen cylinders to prevent the black marketing.</p>
